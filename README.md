# V√§lkommen (Welcome)!
Why did we greet you in Sweedish? You'll never know, and neither will we.

This repository is based on the FtcRobotController, and this is where all of our code goes. You can find the code that we wrote inside the `TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/FTC/teamcode` directory. From there, there is another README explaining the anatomy and layout of the source code.

You can find the original README (for the FtcRobotController repository) [here](https://github.com/FIRST-Tech-Challenge/FtcRobotController).

## Byggnad (Building)!
### F√∂ruts√§ttningar (Prerequisites)
1. JDK 11 (JDK 6+ is required for Gradle, and FTC seems only to like JDK 11)
2. Gradle (not strictly required, the wrapper should install it for you)
3. An IDE of your choice

### L√•t oss forts√§tta med det (Let's get on with it)
Because of the nature of the FTC Tech Challenge (yes, I know, [RAS syndome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAS_syndrome)), all of our code is put inside of the FtcRobotController source tree. They use `gradle`, and so do we. Never used Gradle? Well, you don't need to. Android Studio (our IDE of choice, for most of us anyway) already has Gradle integration, so building should be as simple as pressing the build button. As for running the program, please refer to the original FtcRobotController repository.

However, if you are an enterprising person, you may want to do things "the old-fashioned way", and use the command line. Lucky for us, Gradle is a command-line tool (in fact, Android Studio calls it). You can find the official documentation for building a Gradle project from the command line [here](https://spring.io/guides/gs/gradle/). For your convenience, we have listed the steps below!

```bash
# The only step you need to do to compile your code again is the ./gradlew builds command.
# If this is your first time, follow the instructions below.
# Check your java version

java --version

# If you have anything other than verison 11, you will need to install it, because Java is
# Java. Fear not, this is a simple process. If 11 is installed, skip to the bottom.

# First, we install a tool that lets you manage your Java versions.
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
echo source \"$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh\" >> ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc
source ~/.$(basename $SHELL)rc

# Next, you can install JDK 11 (what we want)
sdk install java 11.0.11.hs-adpt

# You should now be good to go! If you encountered any errors, please email/text/contact:
#   Milo Banks <milobanks@rowlandhall.org>

./gradlew build
```

That's it. `gradlew` is a script that downloads Gradle and runs the commands for you, so there's no fuss! This README will be extended to contain instructions on how to run this "binary" from the command line when we figure it out.

### libOpenCvAndroid453.so
For Easy Open Cv to work you have to download the libOpenCvAndroid453.so file and copy it to the robot controller; you can find download and further instructions [here](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV)
